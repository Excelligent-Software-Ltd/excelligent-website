                            <p>Teachers assign weekly spelling lists to entire classes, setting start and due dates. This works alongside your existing curriculum and schemes.</p>

                <h2>The Science of Retention</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Cadmus Spelling is built on decades of cognitive science research into how humans learn and remember.</p>

                <div class="science-grid">
                    <div class="science-card">
                        <h3>Spaced Repetition</h3>
                        <p>Rather than cramming information, we review material at increasing intervals. This spacing effect dramatically improves long-term retention by strengthening memory consolidation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="science-card">
                        <h3>Active Recall</h3>
                        <p>Students actively retrieve spellings from memory rather than passively reading them. This retrieval practice is one of the most effective learning strategies identified by research.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="science-card">
                        <h3>Immediate Feedback</h3>
