                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p class="lead">At Excelligent Software, we believe that true learning isn't measured by test scores—it's measured by what students remember and can apply weeks, months, and years later.</p>
                <p class="lead">We're building a new generation of educational technology designed around one core principle: <strong>retention is everything</strong>.</p>
                <p>Traditional educational software focuses on engagement metrics, completion rates, and short-term performance. These are important, but they're not enough. If students forget what they've learned shortly after the test, we haven't truly educated them—we've just trained them to perform.</p>
                <p>Our approach is different. Every product we build is designed from the ground up to maximise long-term retention using proven cognitive science principles. We're not just making learning more convenient—we're making it more effective.</p>

                    <h3>Science First</h3>

                <h2>Why We Started with Spelling</h2>
                <p>Spelling is the perfect starting point for our retention-focused approach. It's a foundational skill that every student needs to master, yet it's plagued by the same retention problems we see across education:</p>
                
                <ul class="journey-list">
                    <li>Students cram for weekly tests then forget the words</li>
                    <li>Teachers spend hours administering and marking tests</li>
                    <li>One-size-fits-all lists don't meet individual needs</li>
                    <li>There's no systematic approach to ensuring long-term retention</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With Cadmus Spelling, we've proven that intelligent, personalised revision can transform outcomes. Students truly master and retain their spellings—not just for Friday's test, but for life.</p>

                <p><strong>But we're not stopping at spelling.</strong></p>
